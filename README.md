## What I Learned 🧠

In the development of this Snake Game project, I acquired valuable knowledge and skills, including:

1. **Game Development with Pygame** 🎮: I learned how to create a 2D game using Pygame, a popular Python library for game development.

2. **Collision Detection** 🚧: I implemented collision detection to handle interactions between the snake and food, ensuring game logic runs smoothly.

3. **Game Over Conditions** ⚠️: I developed game over conditions for scenarios like snake collision with walls and self, providing players with a clear end to the game.

4. **High Score Tracking** 🏆: I implemented a high score system, storing and updating high scores in a text file.

5. **User Interface with Tkinter** 💼: I added a user interface for level selection using Tkinter, enabling players to choose game difficulty.

6. **Sound Effects and Music Integration** 🔊: I incorporated sound effects and music to enhance the gaming experience, making it more immersive.

The development of this Snake Game project has not only improved my Python programming skills but also introduced me to the world of game development and user interface design.
